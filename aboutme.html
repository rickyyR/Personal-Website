									<h2>I am a Software Engineer from Germany</h2>
									<p>Well, officially I am still in learning until I can do my exam in 2023, that's the big timer you can see on the landing page. I am quite excited to be able to finally join the industry and expand on my knowledge.</p>
									<p>I came to IT and programming by chance, even though I have a fable for technology and especially computers, I was quite lost after finishing school and didn't know which way I should pursue. Even though my grades were quite bad because of lacking motivation, sooner or later, after looking into all kinds of jobs, I tried to get an apprenticeship in software engineering... and failed. </p>
									<p>I worked as a mechanic for electrical motors for some time since I also like mechanical things and crafts, for me IT was ruled out as a career path, however, my excitement for technology and computers wasn't lost, I was still learning in my free time.</p>
									<p>After some time I was getting demotivated because the work was no longer a challenge, also I felt a little bit out of place at work, ideas of pursuing IT came back to mind and when I got the lucky opportunity to switch fields and start an apprenticeship in software engineering, I took it!</p>
